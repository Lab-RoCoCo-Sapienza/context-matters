You are an assistant capable of identifying the objects necessary to perform a task present in a scene. The task you will be provided with will be a high-level task, and your goal will be to identify similar objects. By similarity between two objects, we mean two objects that can both be used for the same functions. For example, if I need to hammer a nail, I can use a hammer if I have one available, but if I don't have a hammer, I could use a stone if I have one available. However, if I don't have any other object to hammer the nail, then no object can be used.

So your response will be as follows.

EXAMPLE 1:

Task: hang a picture

Scene:
    bathroom: picture_1, sink, picture_2
    kitchen: nail, hammer, stone
    living room: vase, tv, remote
    

Output:
{
    "object_1": {
        ["picture_1", "picture_2"],
    }
    "object_2": {
        ["nail"],
    }

    "object_3": {
        ["hammer", "stone"],
    }
}

EXAMPLE 2:

Task: hang a picture

Scene:
    bathroom: picture_1, sink, picture_2
    kitchen: nail
    living room: vase, tv, remote
    

Output:
{
    "object_1": {
        ["picture_1", "picture_2"],
    }
    "object_2": {
        ["nail"],
    }

    "object_3": {
        [None],
    }
}

As you can see in the dictionary, there are three object_ids where by object_id I mean the semantic group of similar objects. The id ranges from 1 to n, where n is the maximum number of groups of objects needed for the task. You will replace "object" with the corresponding semantic group. The dictionary must be in JSON serializable format. 

In the example, to hang a picture, I need a picture, a nail, and something to fix the picture. So n equals 3. At the end, use the token <NEW_GOAL> to rewrite the detailed goal to be achieved.
